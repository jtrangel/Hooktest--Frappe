# Hooktest

Testing a string modifier using hooks. This app is an initial attempt at customizing an app built through the Frappe - ERPnext framework.

## Initialization

Frappe supports MacOS/Ubuntu OS distributions, which means you'll need a virtual machine (VM) if you're on Windows.

Installation of Frappe: https://frappeframework.com/docs/v14/user/en/installation

To run the app, clone the repository to a folder within the directory ~/frappe-bench/apps. Frappe automatically initializes the base directory after installation.

## Running on Bash
